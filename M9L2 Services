Services have three main names, and also can have a description of the service defined in the registry:
  
  Process name: The name of the running process like svchost.exe, spoolsvc.exe, or mdm.exe (seen using the tasklist /svc, Task Manager, or Process Explorer applications)
  Internal name: Defined in the registry
  Display name: Seen in administrative tools (optional; if not defined the internal name is used)


Earlier lessons discussed the various object types in PowerShell and compared them to the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) objects and properties. 
In order to see additional details regarding these services, like the image path of the executable, the Get-CIMInstance cmdlet is used instead of Get-Service. 
Additionally, the service properties for CanPauseAndContinue, CanShutdown, and CanStop are displayed. The CanPauseAndContinue property indicates if the service can be paused and resumed. 
The CanShutdown property indicates if the service should be notified when the system is shutting down. The CanStop property indicates if the service can be stopped after it has started. 
The CanStop property can be targeted by attackers to make it very difficult to stop a malicious service after it has started, and usually requires configuring the system to not start the service on a reboot in order to completely mitigate it. 
Services with the CanStop property set to False are usually critical services related to security that may compromise the OS if stopped.

Run the following command to use WMI to view the details of the Print Spooler local service:

SYNTAX Get-CIMInstance win32_service | ?{$_.Name -like '*spool*'} | select * SYNTAX
