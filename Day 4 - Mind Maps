Overview of Mind Maps
  Mind maps are visual diagrams utilizing two-dimensional structures with connecting lines — instead of the conventional list format — to connect ideas and events. 
  Connecting points to see how items relate to one another is an important benefit when dealing with elaborate information, such as during process planning, strategy development, and investigative events. 
  An effective mind map shows the interconnectivity of individual points or events that assemble together to create a larger event or project. 
  The structure makes complex information easier to remember.
