OPNOTES Overview

OPNOTEs are important to the investigative and reporting lifecycle throughout the Cyberspace Operations (CO) process. 
It is vital that each of the participating CDAs record standardized OPNOTEs.
They must be clear and concise including, but not limited to, the following:
  Time/date
  Host name
  Internet Protocol
  Description

Providing context to the action or artifact enables readers to understand severity, scale, and scope of what is being described. 

Producing fact-based, evidence-supported notes of actions performed supports a defensible timeline. 
This timeline could be used to deconflict activity performed outside the investigating team.
