Mapping Detailed Threat Assessment Report Information to Mitre ATT&CK Framework
  MITRE ATT&CK is a curated knowledge base and model for cyber adversary behavior, reflecting the various phases of an adversaryâ€™s attack lifecycle and the platforms they are known to target. 
  ATT&CK originated out of a project to enumerate and categorize post-compromise adversary TTPs against Windows Operating Systems (OS) to improve detection of malicious activity.
