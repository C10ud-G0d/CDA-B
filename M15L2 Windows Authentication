The Seven Laws of Identity 

1. User Control and Consent: Digital identity systems must only reveal information identifying a user with the user's consent.


2. Limited Disclosure for Limited Use: The solution that discloses the least identifying information and best limits its use is the most stable, long-term solution.


3. The Law of Fewest Parties: Digital identity systems must limit disclosure of identifying information to parties having a necessary and justifiable place in a given identity relationship.


4. Directed Identity: A universal identity metasystem must support both omnidirectional identifiers for use by public entities and unidirectional identifiers for private entities, thus facilitating discovery while preventing unnecessary release of correlation handles.


5. Pluralism of Operators and Technologies: A universal identity metasystem must channel and enable the interworkings of multiple identity technologies run by multiple identity providers.


6. Human Integration: A unifying identity metasystem must define the human user as a component integrated through protected and unambiguous human-machine communications.


7. Consistent Experience Across Contexts: A unifying identity metasystem must provide a simple consistent experience while enabling separation of contexts through multiple operators and technologies.


NOTE: A metasystem is a system comprised of small systems connected together.
