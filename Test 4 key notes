VLANS logically break or segment networks

IN BAND is physical connection

RSPAN is on same domain

ERSPAN is on multiple domains

Port security maximum vlan access

Primary routing protocols

OSPF 
  Builds link state database based off of all connection points 
  If all routers have the same info in their database instead of being neighbors they're adjacent neighbors
  neighbors just route data through 

  Cost: speed higher the speed cheaper the cost 
  OSPF goes for higher speed

  

BGP
  AS: ATT&T, Verizion, T Mobile, etc

  Used externally to connect multiple AS together


AS_PATH 
  READ RIGHT TO LEFT

SMB

  default shares
  C$
  IPC

NBTSTAT shows what share are availible tells us standalone device and what domains it belongs too

IPS: changes and detects
IDS: detects
firewalls: prevents

network IPS: located on the network

NMAP Is your friend
