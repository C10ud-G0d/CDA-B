A hub has 1 broadcast domain and 1 collison domain

CISCO DEVICES

The basic security model for Cisco devices consists of three privilege levels: Zero, User, and Privileged. While more can be configured, these are the default. 
The enable command can be used to raise privilege levels to 15 (Privileged), and the disable command can be used to lower the privilege levels to 1 (User). 
An enable password can be configured to require a password in order to raise the privilege level. These commands can optionally specify a specific privilege level (0,1,15) as discussed below.

Can raise privilege level by typing enable

Privilege level 0 is the lowest level privilege defined by default on Cisco devices. When connected with privilege level 0, the connected user only has access to these commands:

Privilege level 1. At this level — in addition to the above commands — some additional utilities are available for troubleshooting connectivity, such as the traceroute and ping commands.

Privilege level 15 is the highest level defined by default on Cisco devices. At this privilege level, all commands are available, and the device can be configured.
