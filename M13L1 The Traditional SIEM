Data Aggregation
  SIEMs aggregate and consolidate data from across the enterprise’s network devices and endpoints. Each node on the network continually processes large amounts of data. A SIEM is able to aggregate the data being processed.

Data Normalization
  Aggregated data often has disparities and different fields. Data normalization is the process of structuring data commonly found in a relational database or SIEM. 
  The data is structured in accordance with a series of normal forms. The normal forms are filters designed to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. 
  
  The filters process the data by organizing it to avoid:
      Data Redundancy: Unintentional occurrence of the same piece of data being held in two separate places
      Insertion Anomaly: Inability to add data to the database or SIEM due to absence of other data
      Update Anomaly: Data inconsistency that results from data redundancy
      Deletion Anomaly: Unintended loss of data due to deletion of other data

Centralized Dashboard
  SIEMs aggregate and consolidate data from across the enterprise’s network devices and endpoints into one centralized dashboard. 
  The dashboard is updated in realtime and allows an analyst to see a live snapshot of the enterprise. A sample dashboard is provided in Figure 13.1-2:
