PowerShell scripting is greatly enhanced by producing your own classes, properties, and methods. Classes can be instantiated to produce objects - though, these are not the only types of objects in PowerShell.

Objects in PowerShell include:

Classes
PSCustomObject
Hashtables

Import-module then give .ps1 of class

Get-Childitem -Path C:\ -Include XmlLite.dll -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

(Get-ProcessesWithModules | Where ProcessName -eq "Explorer").Modules | Sort

(Get-ProcessesWithModules | Where ProcessName -eq "Explorer").Modules | where {$_.length -eq 12}
