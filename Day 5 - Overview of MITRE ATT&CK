What is the ATT&CK Framework?

  MITRE’s ATT&CK is a framework for modeling cyber threat adversary behaviors in their varied complexity. 
  It consists of a knowledge base of known behaviors, which characterizes those behaviors both at a high level for conceptual understanding and with the granular historical detail required to see how the model correctly fits actual attacks that have occurred. 
  The model reflects the various phases of an adversary’s attack lifecycle and the platforms they are known to target, but is free from the rigidity of a linear attack chain.
