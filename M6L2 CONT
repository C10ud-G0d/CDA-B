FIND Command
  The find command searches for files in a directory hierarchy from a specified starting point, or multiple starting points, in the directory tree.


GREP and EGREP Commands
  The grep command searches the named input file for lines containing a match to the given pattern. If no files are specified, or if the file - is given, grep searches standard input.

  -r, --recursive — Read all files under each directory, recursively
  -i, --ignore-case — Ignore case distinction in both the PATTERN and the input files
  -w, --word-regexp — Only return lines containing matches that form whole words
  -x, --line-regexp — Only return matches that exactly match the whole line
  -c, --count — Suppress normal output and only print a count of matching lines for each input file

CAT Command
  The cat command concatenates files and prints on the standard output.

-n, --number — Number all output lines

CUT Command
  The cut command removes sections from each line of a file. 

  -b, --bytes=LIST — Select only these bytes
  -c, --characters=LIST — Select only these characters
  -d, --delimiter=DELIM — Use DELIM instead of TAB for field delimiter
  -f, --fields=LIST — Select only these fields; also print any line that contains no delimiter character, unless -s option is specified
  -s, --only-delimited — Only print lines that contain delimiters
  --output-delimiter=STRING — Use STRING as the output delimiter; the default is to use the input delimiter
  -z, --zero-terminated — Line delimiter is NULL, not newline

 SYNTAX cut -d ":" -f1,7 /etc/passwd SYNTAX

etc/passwd
username:password:user ID:group ID:user name or comment:home directory: command interpreter or shell

TR Command

SORT Command
  The sort command sorts lines of text files to standard output, or from standard input if no files are specified.

DIFF Command
  The diff command compares files line by line to identify differences.

SLEEP Command
  The sleep command delays for a specified amount of time. This is useful if there is a task happening in the background or a script needs to wait a specified amount of time before doing another task.

WATCH Command
  The watch command runs a command repeatedly, displaying its output and errors, which allows you to watch the programs output change over time.

LSOF Command
  The lsof command, or LiSt Open Files, lists standard output file information about files opened by processes.

TIMEOUT Command
  The timeout command runs a command with a time limit and kills it if still running after a set duration.

SED Command

AWK and GAWK Commands
  The awk and gawk commands are used for pattern scanning and processing of files and standard input. 

  SYNTAX awk 'BEGIN { FS=":" }; {print $1,$7}' /etc/passwd SYNTAX
